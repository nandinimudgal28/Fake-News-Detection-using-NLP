# Fake News Detection using NLP

A machine learning project to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as tokenization, word embeddings, padding, and visualizations like word clouds and confusion matrices.

## Overview

This project aims to classify news articles as *real* or *fake* based on their content. By leveraging core NLP techniques and deep learning preprocessing methods, the model identifies deceptive or misleading information effectively.

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **TensorFlow / Keras**
* **NLTK / spaCy**
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn / WordCloud**
* **Jupyter Notebook**

## Features

* Text preprocessing: tokenization, stop word removal, padding
* Word embedding for semantic understanding
* Word cloud visualization of common terms
* Confusion matrix for model performance evaluation
* Accurate binary classification (Real vs Fake news)

## Output Samples

* Word cloud of frequent fake and real news terms
* Confusion matrix showcasing classification accuracy
* Label predictions on test dataset

## Results

Achieved reliable classification through careful preprocessing and visualization, with strong performance evaluated using confusion matrix metrics.
